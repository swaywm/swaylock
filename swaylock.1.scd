# SYNOPSIS

Locks your Wayland session.

# OPTIONS

	_$HOME/.swaylock/config_, _$XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME/swaylock/config_, and
	_SYSCONFDIR/swaylock/config_. All flags aside from this one are valid
	options in the configuration file using the format _long-option=value_.
	For options such as _ignore-empty-password_, just supply the _long-option_.
	All leading dashes should be omitted and the equals sign is required for
	flags that take an argument.
